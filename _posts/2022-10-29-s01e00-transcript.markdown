**Rhyd**: Hi and welcome to this very short introduction to the Rethink Everything podcast launching this Wednesday.

Each week, I'll meet a new guest and discuss a defining event in their life that made them pause for a moment and rethink everything. With a 20 minute running time, each episode will be an easy and memorable listen â€” perhaps on a walk, during your commute or as a reprieve from the news...

I'm your host Rhyd Lewis. I'm a product consultant who helps organisations rethink how they create value for their customers. I'm intrigued by the stories of how people use critical moments to rethink their approach to work and life and I'd like to use this podcast to share some of those stories with you.

Rethink Everything episode 1 is out on Wednesday November the 2nd. I'll be speaking to Leda Glyptis, Chief Client Officer at 10x Banking about that moment that made her rethink everything.

Head over to [rethinkeverything.show](https://rethinkeverything.show) to find out more.

I hope you can join us. Thanks!
